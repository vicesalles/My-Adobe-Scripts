# My-Adobe-Scripts
Scripts for automating few tasks on Photoshop and After Effects. The scripts are divided into two folders, the PSD and the AE one. I'll add more as soon as I need new ones.

###PSD Folder
The Photoshop scripts are mostly oriented to breaking text into parts.

###AE Folder
The After Effects scripts are mostly basic transitions of fading in/out elements

##How to use
Simply select the layer you want to transform and run the script from the 'File' menu.
